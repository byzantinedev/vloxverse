# FAQ

## What is a Vlox?

The name Vlox comes from 'Voxel' and 'Blocks'. It represents a cubic volume at a certain location in 3d space. Every Vlox is subdivisible into 8 equal Vloxes, which themselves are also subdivisible and so on. Thus, Vloxes at different 'depths' have different sizes. 

## Why use Vloxes?

Unlike typical voxels that are uniformly sized, Vloxes offer more creative freedom to have greater detail in specific areas as desired. Vloxes also offer huge performance improvements due to the ability to render differently based on the distance from the camera, resulting in increased distance visibility and higher detail at near distances.

## Who created Vloxverse?

That would be me, ByzantineDev. Yup, I'm just one person. Feel free to follow me on X/Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, TikTok. Thanks!

## Is Vloxverse open source?

Yes!

## How is the project funded?

Due to Vloxverse being free and open source, you get full access to all features for FREE. I value your privacy, so I don't collect/sell your data either. If you love Vloxverse I hope you'll consider donating to help support the project and allow me to continue working on it full time.
